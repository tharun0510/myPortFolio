            <p class="date-1">(Java, Mysql, JDBC, Blockchain)</p>

            <p class="content-1">• Introducing a Privacy-Preserving Searchable Encryption (PPSE) scheme using public and
                private blockchains:
                Encrypted indices stored in a private blockchain and documents in a public blockchain enable efficient
                retrieval
                with minimized storage overhead. <br>
                • Utilizing smart contracts for access control: Secondary verification mechanisms through smart
                contracts ensure
                data privacy and access control on the private blockchain, enhancing security while maintaining query
                efficiency</p>

            <p class="date-1">(Java, Mysql, Hibernate ORM, Eclipse)</p>

            <p class="content-1">• Database Integration and Data Retrieval: Orchestrated the integration of a Hospital Management System with
                Hibernate ORM, facilitating seamless storage and retrieval of Doctor and Patient details from the database. Implemented efficient data fetching mechanisms to retrieve real-time information, enhancing system responsiveness
                and usability.
                <br>
                • Eclipse Integration and Development: Leveraged Eclipse IDE for Java development to streamline project workflows. Utilized Eclipse’s robust toolset to seamlessly integrate Hibernate ORM with the application, enabling
                smooth data access and manipulation within the Hospital Management System.</p>
